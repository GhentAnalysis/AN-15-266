% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
   We present a search for the production of dark matter particles coupled to the standard model top quark via a scalar or pseudoscalar messenger particle. The search is conducted in the opposite-sign dilepton channel using $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected by the CMS detector.
   Search regions are  split in same-flavor ($ee$, $\mu\mu$) and different-flavor ($e\mu$) channels after a baseline selection of two jets, of which at least one is $b$-tagged, and large missing transverse energy.
   The signal regions are defined using the \mtll variable which efficiently separates the signal from the dominant \ttbar background.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.

%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
