\section{Background estimation}
\label{sec:background_estimations}
In this section, we summarize the estimation procedures for the different background components. We separately estimate the \ttbar, DY, diboson and \ttbar+Z backgrounds for
each signal region. 
  \input{ttjets}
  \input{DY}
  \input{ttZ}
\subsection{Rare backgrounds}
Rare backgrounds whose contribution is negligible in all search regions are \ttbar production in association with a Higgs boson and triple gauge boson background.
Those are taken from simulation and assigned an uncertainty of 50\%.
