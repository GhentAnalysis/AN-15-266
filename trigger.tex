\section{Triggers}
\label{sec:trigger}

In this analysis we use various sets of triggers in order to achieve an optimal selection efficiency. For each dilepton channel ($ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$) we take the logical OR
of the dilepton triggers listed in Tab.~\ref{table:triggers} thus combining isolated and non-isolated triggers.
We moreover complement the partially inefficient dilepton triggers by single lepton triggers and remove the overlap between two primary data sets by vetoing events that 
fired a dilepton trigger in the single lepton primary data sets.
Because the e$\mu$ channel is complemented by two single lepton primary data sets, the procedure has two steps: We first add events from the {\verb SingleElectron } primary data set
that fired single electron triggers but failed the double lepton triggers that we use to select events in the {\verb MuonEG } primary data set. We furthermore add events from the
{\verb SingleMuon } primary data set that fired single muon triggers but fired none of the triggers we use to select events in either the {\verb MuonEG } or the {\verb SingleElectron } primary data set.

Table \ref{table:triggers} gives an overview of all triggers used in this analysis.

We measure the trigger efficiencies in the unbiased {\verb MET } and {\verb JetHT } data sets which give consistent results. 
We use the measurement obtained in the {\verb MET } because of the smaller statistical uncertainties.
There is a significant inefficiency for muons with high transverse momentum in the muon endcaps, hence
we parametrize the trigger inefficiency as a function of the two lepton momenta and define two bins of the $\eta$ of the leading lepton that are separated by $|\eta|=1.5$. In the e$\mu$ channel, we bin the measurement in the same way but we take the $\eta$ of the muon, whether it is leading or not. 
The measured trigger efficiencies are used to scale the simulation.

Figure~\ref{fig:additionalTriggers} shows the gain in trigger efficiency by including the non-isolated double-lepton and, additionally, the single-lepton triggers for the example of the $\mu\mu$ channel and for $|\eta|>1.5$ for the leading muon. The improvement at high transverse momenta is dramatic. All other trigger efficiency maps show less prominent effects and are collected in Appendix~\ref{app:triggerEff}.
